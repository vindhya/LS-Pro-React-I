# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* let
		* The `let` syntax is similar to `var` from ES5, however, the scope is bound to the block which it is defined within.
	* const
		* `const` is used to declare variables as well, but does not allow changing the value of the variable after it's first definition.
	* ES6 Classes
		* ES6 classes are a simpler way of writing constructor functions.
	* import/export
		* `import` brings assets into the current file/scope. For example, it may be used on the React framework, css files, image files, even other JavaScript classes.
		* The `export` command allows exporting of a class so that the component can be used by other parts of the app.
	* JSX
		* JSX is how HTML is referenced within React. It has special syntax to call upon JavaScript variables/syntax.
	* this.props
		* `this.props` grabs any HTML attributes attached to the object currently being worked with.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called Profile. `create-react-app profile`
	* Navigate into /profile and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<NavBar />` and a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Body.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Body />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Body />` will display some information about yourself.
	* Try adding an image, some text, and some links to your github profile.
	* For the content in `<Body />` try to break things down into their own components as much as you can.  The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating basic components.  You should be very comfortable with the basic syntax of creating React components before the next lesson.
